# VINS-Mono for Client-Server Architecture
This repository contains a client-server version of [VINS-Mono](https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/VINS-Mono). It is based on the original VINS-Mono implementation, with the additional capacity of sending information back to a server fusing the sensory data from multiple robots.  
This repository is used in a wider framework for multi-robot path planning, available [here](https://github.com/VIS4ROB-lab/multi_robot_coordination).  

If you use this VINS-Mono version in your academic work, please cite the original VINS-Mono paper and this publication:  
_"Multi-robot Coordination with Agent-Server Architecture for Autonomous Navigation in Partially Unknown Environments"_ by Luca Bartolomei, Marco Karrer and Margarita Chli, IROS 2020.
